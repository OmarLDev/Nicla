## Nicla's chef at home website proposal

I was requested to redesign a website for a friend who works as a chef at home. I took some of the materials she currently uses and tried my best to improve the visuals and show 
a better designed website.

This is still a work in progress since distance has not helped in communication.

As per the request, this is only a front website which requires no further logic.
